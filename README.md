Abstract
One in four people suffer from mental illnesses at one point in their lives, this is not only in
Kenya, but throughout the world according to the World Health Organizationâ€™s report. Before the pandemic hit, mental illness was regarded as a topic of controversy in public debate. After the pandemic hit, mental health was taken seriously by employees who were aware that it hampered the productivity of its employees. Many people do not seek help for mental health problems because of issues such as stigmatization, lack of access to mental health services and lack of finances to visit mental health clinics. The main aim of the project is to develop a website that will use machine learning algorithms that have been trained on a large number of mental health assessment data sets to help the users diagnose their mental health problems, overtime it will be updated to improve its accuracy. The users can anonymously complete the mental health assessments and their data will be kept confidential. The machine learning algorithms will be trained to find a specific diagnosis of mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder. The website will be an effective tool to raise awareness on mental health issues and it will have a major impact on mental health care while encouraging people to seek help when necessary.
